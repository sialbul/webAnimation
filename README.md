Websites app is a combination of the web pages I like. All pages are created by using Javascript, SCSS and HTML and they are all mobile view.
For fonts, google fonts were used.
First page is a full screen app with animations. I used GSAP timelinemax and tweenmax to add all the javascript animations.
When clicked the chef image, you will direct to chef website. In this website, AOS is used for flip images and image slides made by javascript. 
For photographer website, it is one page blog site with image scale feature with dark screen mode.
