Websites app is a combination of the web pages I like. All pages are created by using Javascript, SCSS and HTML and they are all mobile view.
For fonts, google fonts are used.
First page is a full screen page with animations. I used GSAP timelinemax and tweenmax to add all the javascript animations.
When clicked the chef image, you will direct to chef website. AOS is used for flip images. Image slide made by javascript. 
For photographer web page, it is one page-like a blog page with image scale feature.
